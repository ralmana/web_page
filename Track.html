    <p>Track and Field is my favorite sport. I love it because it makes me test how far I can go in my goals I set for myself, and how to overcome challenges strategically. Below I listed the 2 main events that I do which in my opinion are the most mentally strategic ones. To learn more about Track and Field, look at the <a href="https://worldathletics.org/"> World Athletics website.</a></p>

        <p>Long distance races typically range from 800 meters to the marathon (42.195 kilometers). These events test endurance, pace strategy, and mental toughness.</p>

        <p>Throwing competitions in Track and Field include the shot put, discus throw, hammer throw, and javelin throw. Each event has unique techniques and requires strength, technique, and precision.</p>
